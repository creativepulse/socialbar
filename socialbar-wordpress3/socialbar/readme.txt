Social Bar helps users share your website in popular social networks

== Description ==

Social Bar works as a widget that appears next to your article/content. It shows social network widgets like Facebook like counter, or a Twitter interaction counter etc.

This extension is customizable, allowing webmasters to show the social network widgets of their choice. In the list of available pre-defined choices this extension also features the capability to add completely custom links.

This extension is MVC compatible. Those with enough experience with the PHP computing language can write their own layout mechanism (viewer).
